## About

This theme is a port of the [Dracula Color Theme](https://github.com/kevinvn1709/vscode-dracula-color-theme) originally created by [kevinvn1709](https://github.com/kevinvn1709) for VS Code.

The color scheme has been converted to Zed Editor format using Zed's official [theme_importer](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/crates/theme_importer) tool, with additional adjustments for optimal appearance in Zed.
